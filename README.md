# JFSJD Assessment Code

This repository contains two simple Java programs for the JFSJD assessment.

## 1. StringReverse.java
- Takes a sentence as input from the user.
- Reverses each word in the sentence, keeping the word order the same.
- Example: `"Java is fun"` â†’ `"avaJ si nuf"`

## 2. StudentList.java
- Contains a hardcoded array of Student objects (name and marks).
- Sorts the students by marks in ascending order using basic bubble sort.
- Example output:
`Students sorted by marks:
Vikram - 78
Rahul - 85
Neha - 89
Anjali - 92`
